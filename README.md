# RetroPie-Scripts
Bundle of custom retropie scripts (bash) to run special/repetitive tasks on a raspberry pi4. 
These have been tested on a raspberry pi 4 with Virtualman v1.98x-4.5.7
These scripts can seriusly damage your system or delete files. Always create a backup before attempting to run any of these.
I will take no responsability if your systems wont work or breaks.
